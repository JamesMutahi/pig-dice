# PIG DICE
#### This is a two player dice game
#### By **James Mutahi**
## Description
This game is played by two players who each roll a dice. The first to 100 wins.
However, there are some conditions to be met:
1. If and when a player rolls a one, he/she loses the cumulative die roll and relinquishes the turn to the other player.
2. The hold button can be used to switch to the other player if you do not wish to continue rolling.
